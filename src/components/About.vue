            My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prav25/" target="_blank">Praneeth Ravuri</a>, and I'm passionate about crafting innovative solutions through <a href="https://github.com/praneethravuri" target="_blank">software engineering</a>. My journey into the world of technology began in 2020 during the COVID lockdown, where I first discovered my love for programming through Python. What started with simple automation scripts soon evolved into building web scrapers for e-commerce platforms, marking my first step into practical software development.

            <br><br>

            As my curiosity grew, I ventured into web development, starting with WordPress and blogger.com. This self-initiated exploration led to an exciting opportunity as the web developer for my university's IEEE student body. Though I faced challenges with CSS and responsive design, each obstacle only fueled my determination to master frontend development. This early experience laid the foundation for my later roles, including a frontend internship at Stige where I tackled cross-browser compatibility challenges and optimized web application performance.

            My journey continued at Cognizant, where I delved into the world of real-time communication platforms and RESTful services. Now, at Prodapt, I'm engineering distributed data pipelines and working with cutting-edge technologies like Go and Kafka to process telemetry data from thousands of network devices. Along the way, I've completed my Master's in Computer Science from George Mason University, where I deepened my theoretical knowledge while working on exciting projects like AI-powered traffic systems and LLM-based applications.

            What excites me most about software engineering is the endless opportunity to innovate and solve complex problems. Whether it's optimizing system performance, designing scalable architectures, or creating intuitive user interfaces, I'm always eager to take on new challenges. <a href="mailto:pravdevrav@gmail.com">Let's connect</a> if you'd like to discuss technology, collaboration opportunities, or share interesting ideas!
