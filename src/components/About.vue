        <p>My name is Praneeth Ravuri, and I love developing websites. I began my journey in 2020 during
            the COVID lockdown, starting with Python and creating small projects. I quickly gained a strong understanding of
            the language and used it to build bots for scraping e-commerce websites.
            <br>
            I then ventured into building blogs on platforms like WordPress and blogger.com. This led to my appointment as a
            web developer for the IEEE student body at my university. While working on enhancing the user interface of the
            existing website, I faced challenges with CSS but persisted through them.
            <br>
            With two internships in software and web development under my belt, I have now advanced to developing full-stack
            applications with diverse use cases. I am driven by my passion for web development and actively seeking exciting
            full-time opportunities in the field. Feel free to reach out to me through my inbox for networking and
            connections.
