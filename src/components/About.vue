            Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prav25/" target="_blank">Praneeth Ravuri</a>, a software engineer with a passion for building practical solutions. My interest in programming began in 2020 during the COVID lockdown when I started learning Python. What began as a hobby of writing small scripts soon grew into creating tools like web scrapers, which marked my first steps into software development.

            <br><br>

            Over time, I explored web development and took on roles like managing my university IEEE student body’s website. These experiences helped me learn problem-solving and sharpen my skills in creating user-friendly designs and systems.

            <br><br>

            Now, I work as a Software Engineer at Prodapt, where I focus on designing data pipelines to process metrics from network devices. Using tools like Golang and Kafka, I build systems that are both scalable and reliable. I’ve also completed my Master’s in Computer Science at George Mason University, where I worked on exciting projects like AI-based traffic systems and apps powered by large language models.

            <br><br>

            I enjoy tackling challenges, whether it’s improving performance, designing better systems, or solving unique problems. Feel free to <a href="mailto:pravdevrav@gmail.com">get in touch</a> if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or share ideas!
